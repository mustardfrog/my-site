        Hi, my name is Sithu Maung Maung Cho, a 22 years old a developer from
        Burma.
        <br />
        <br />
        Passionate enthusiast with a knack for graphics and game development. Devoted
        programmer with a deep love for creative expression through digital art.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of coding, I enjoy diving into video games, sketching, strumming
        on the guitar, and immersing myself in anime, movies, and the beats of rap
        music.
        <br />
